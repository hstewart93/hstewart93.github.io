    DataAid unites the analytical skills and expertise of PhD students in the Data Intensive â€“ CDT and 
    Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Advanced Computing (AIMLAC) Centres for Doctoral Training 
    with charities in need of data support to generate valuable new insights and perspectives on the data 
    they hold. The DataAid programme runs two-day events attended the CDT student cohorts and charity 
    partners.

    There have been three DataAid events to data, with the first event taking place in January 2021 and was 
    fully remote due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second event took place in March 2022 and was a hybrid event with
    some students and charity partners attending in person and others attending remotely. The third event
    took place in March 2023 and was also hybrid. The 2024 event is currently being organised and the recruitment
    of charity partners is underway.

    I co-founded the programme with a fellow PhD student at Bristol, and lead the organisation of all three
    events. I have also been responsible for the recruitment of charity partners, the management of the DataAid committee,
    recruitment and training of student participants.
